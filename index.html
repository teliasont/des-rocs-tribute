      <p class="intro-text yellow-text">Danny Rocco, also known as <span class="oswald-bold">Des Rocs</span>, is an American rock musician from Rockville Centre, New York. Des Rocs is a solo project produced and led by Danny Rocco. When touring, Rocco is joined by his long time friends and bandmates, William Tully and Eric Mendelsohn.</p>
      <p class="orange-text">Rocco began performing in bars and basements from as early as 13 years old. His first band Secret Weapons opened for bands such as Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, and Weezer. The band eventually went on permanent hiatus after bandmate Gerry Lang's health deteriorated.</p>
      <p class="cyan-text">He released his first EP, <span class="album-title">Let The Vultures In</span>, in <span class="date">November 2018</span>. This EP includes his most-played song, “Let Me Live / Let Me Die”, which garnered much attention from music blogs and radio stations. It was followed up by the <span class="album-title">Martyr Parade</span> EP in <span class="date">2019</span>.</p>
      <p class="pink-text">In the summer of <span class="date">2019</span>, Des Rocs got the opportunity to open for The Rolling Stones, which spiked his popularity dramatically.</p>
      <p class="yellow-text">A third EP, <span class="album-title">This Is Our Life</span>, was released in <span class="date">2020</span> and showcased his ability to blend stadium-sized rock anthems with introspective lyrics.</p>
      <p class="orange-text">In the spring of <span class="date">2021</span>, Des Rocs announced the <span class="tour">Alive</span> tour and a virtual livestream concert. During the virtual concert, which was the first live playthrough of <span class="album-title">This is Our Life</span>, Des Rocs culminated with the track "<span class="song-title">Tick</span>" from his then yet-to-be-announced album. The track's lyrics also hinted at the title of the new album, <span class="album-title">A Real Good Person In A Real Bad Place</span>, which was later released in <span class="date">September of 2021</span>.</p>
      <p class="cyan-text">In the spring of <span class="date">2022</span>, the <span class="tour">Once In A Lifetime</span> tour was announced, co-headlining with Canadian rock band The Blue Stones. The tour spanned over 20 cities in the continental United States. Two Des Rocs headlining shows were announced in Salt Lake City, UT and Portland, OR after the initial tour announcement.</p>
      <p class="pink-text">Des Rocs supported Badflower on their <span class="tour">Asking For A Friend</span> tour. They debuted a new song, "<span class="song-title">Never Ending Moment</span>", during this tour, and officially released it on <span class="date">April 25, 2023</span>. At the same time, it was announced that the band had signed with Sumerian Records.</p>
      <p class="yellow-text">On <span class="date">June 13 2023</span>, Des Rocs released the single "<span class="song-title">Nowhere Kid</span>" from his sophomore album <span class="album-title">Dream Machine</span>, which later released on <span class="date">August 25, 2023</span>.</p>
      <p class="orange-text">In <span class="date">November 2023</span>, Des Rocs began the headlining <span class="tour">Dream Machine Tour</span>. While on tour, Dana White, the CEO of UFC happened to catch one of Des Rocs’ shows and was blown away. He goes to two other shows immediately and begins to use Des Rocs’ songs in the UFC marketing.</p>
      <p class="cyan-text">In <span class="date">October 2024</span>, Des Rocs releases <span class="album-title">Dream Machine (The Lucid Edition)</span>, a deluxe album featuring 3 new songs, two live recordings, and a collaboration with the band Underoath.</p>
